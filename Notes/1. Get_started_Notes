Langchain : LangChain is an open source framework with a pre-built agent architecture and integrations for any model or tool — so you can build agents that adapt as fast as the ecosystem evolves.

In simple, A framework to orchestrate LLMs, tools, memory, and workflows.
It helps to build: Agents, RAG systems, Tool-calling apps, Multi step workflow.

Things to know before starting langchain:

1. Python Fundamentals (Very Important)

Functions
Decorators (@tool)
Dictionaries
Loops
Classes (basic)
Virtual environments

LangChain is just Python orchestration around LLMs. 

2. Prompt Engineering Basics [I have covered this info, please refer the Prmompt engineering notes]

What is a system prompt
Message roles (system / user / assistant)
How temperature affects output
Why structured prompts work better
Why vague prompts fail

3. How LLMs Actually Work [ I have covered this info, please refer the LLM notes]

You don’t need deep math, but you must understand:

LLMs predict next tokens
They are probabilistic
They hallucinate
They do not “know” facts in real-time
They follow instructions imperfectly

If you don’t understand this, LangChain will feel random.

Understand the difference,

1. LLM -> Generates text.
2. Tool -> A deterministic fuction.
3. Agent -> An LLM that decides which tool to call.
4. Chain -> A fixed sequence of steps.
