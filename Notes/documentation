Hello I have started learning Langchain for my career growth

I am referring this official langchain docs to learn Langchain.

#Official langchain learn site
https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/

First I installed Langchain on my system. As I am using fedora linus I used this command.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Installing langchain
pip install -U langchain

But make sure it has python 3.10+ installed.

LangChain provides integrations to hundreds of LLMs and thousands of other integrations. 
These live in independent provider packages.

# Installing the OpenAI integration
pip install -U langchain-openai

# Installing the Anthropic integration
pip install -U langchain-anthropic

Not only these you can use any LLM model, but you should get API key of that respective model,
Mostly there are not free
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hence I am using different appproach.

Now what I am doing, this method is free. I am installing LLM locally in my system.
Here there is no paid API option.

#install the Ollama 
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh

#Complete the installation by installing the model ( If your system has 16GB Ram use this )

ollama pull llama3

ollama pull llama3.1 #Again I pulled this one as llama3 doesnot support tool calling.


#If you have 4GB ram then use this

ollama pull phi3

#Then you can run and use like a GenAI model on the terminal.

ollama run llama3 #(Replace llama3 if you have installed difefrent one)

#Now you can ask anything ust like chatgt or anything.




 The Ollama API is now available at 127.0.0.1:11434.
>>> Install complete. Run "ollama" from the command line.
>>> AMD GPU ready.
